# KonamiConfetti Component

## Overview

The `KonamiConfetti` component is a fun, interactive Easter egg that triggers a confetti animation when a user enters the classic Konami code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) on their keyboard. This component leverages the `react-confetti` library to create a celebratory effect that spans the entire height and width of the web page, making it ideal for pages with extensive scrollable content.

## Getting Started

To integrate the `KonamiConfetti` component into your project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the `react-confetti` package

Run the following command to install the necessary package:

```bash
npm install react-confetti
